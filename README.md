# pkg
Common Go libraries for use in my own personal projects

> Note: These package are not intended for broad public use. If you find some utility in them, then great. If you'd like to enter a PR, I will do my best to review it and merge it on its merits. That said, I am not an OSS maintainer and I make no promises for anything.
